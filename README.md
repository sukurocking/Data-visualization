# Data-visualization
This repo contains some of my work based on my practise of data visualization.
The packages used are:
(i)  Leaflet
(ii) Ggplot2
(iii)Plotly

Open the html files to view the visualizations directly or knit the rmd (Rmarkdown) files in RStudio to generate new html. The second way may be more cumbersome, it generate the visualiztions properly.

## Enjoy
